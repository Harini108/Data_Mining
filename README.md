One of the most predominant and critical disease in the recent trend is evidently the breast cancer. Although  experienced radiologists can perform
successful detection of malignant tumors yet these is glitch in the diagnosis of type of cancer. The primary reason behind this trend topic because of its
mortality rate. Researches around the globe have proposed various methodologies for detection of this disease, however it still requires improvisation for accurate and efficient detection. Data mining algorithm can provide great assistance in determination and treatment of BC at early stage. The purpose of this research is to determine how precise these data mining techniques forecast the likelihood of recurrence of BC in patients with the defined parameters. The large volumes of data play a fundamental role according to the literature consulted, a great variety of data set oriented to the analysis of the disease has been generated, in this research the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) was used, the purpose of the proposed research is to submit comparison of
 the performance of various clustering and classification algorithms and conclude the most accurate.This study will help future researchers in breast cancer field to continue their research and focus on improving the performance of specific algorithms.
